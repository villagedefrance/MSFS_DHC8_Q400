DHC8-Q400 Notes:
----------------------
MSFS de Havilland Canada DHC8-Q400 Package. The "Dash 8" Q400 (Q for Quiet) was originally developed and built by Bombardier, but was sold in 2019 to Longview Aviation Capital, who re-instated the de Havilland Canada brand.
Featuring 11 past and present liveries: White (C-GKUK), ASky Airlines (ET-AQD), Air Baltic (YL-BBV), Flybe (G-JEDI), Croatia Airlines (9A-CQB), Westjet Encore (C-GENU), Qantas Link (VH-QOU), Eurowings (D-ABQT), Alaska Airlines (N448QX), ANA Wings (JA841A) and Scandinavian Airlines (LN-RDI).
This aircraft is based on the superb DHC8-Q400 FSX model by Dreamwings, combined with the VC from the MSFS default CJ4 and the sound file from the MSFS default KingAir350. The MDL (model file) has been extensively modified to take full advantage of the new MSFS graphic engine.
All textures are HD quality (2048x2048px). All textures are DDS DXT5. The new model features transparent windows which makes the interior cabin visible, and the new custom lights make the whole aircraft look fantastic at night. 
This quality conversion was created with great care and is not a just a compilation of old and new files. Each file contained within this package has been reworked, optimised for quality, size and performance.
This aircraft does not pretend to be "study level" by any means, it just looks good, was exciting to make, and it is great fun to fly. Enjoy!

INSTALLATION:
---------------
1 - Extract the zip archive in the folder of your choice.

3 - Launch MSFS, Select your new DHC8-Q400 and go flying!

Note: MSFS will automatically create a "dhc8_q400_CVT_" folder after the initial launch.

MSFS FLIGHT MODEL:
--------------------
Make sure your "Flight Model" in MSFS is set to "Modern": Options -> Flight Model -> Modern

KNOWN ISSUES:
---------------
- ATC calls wrongly class the aircraft as "heavy"?
- Missing taxi light on the front center gear strut.
- VC is too far back relative to the exterior model.
- VC is obviously not an accurate representation of a Q400 flightdeck.
- Engine sound is obviously not an accurate representation of a PW150A.
- Propeller RPM animations do not work as expected since SU5 (Hopefully SU6 will fix that).
- Sadly no gloss on textures since SU5.
